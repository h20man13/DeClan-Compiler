# What is DeClan

The Depauw Compilers Language is a subset of the Oberon programing laguage and was designed for the CSC 426 class at Depauw University.
The language features While Loops, For Loops, Repeat Loops, If Statements, And Procedures.

# What is Included in the Compiler
The Compiler contains all the necessary components to Compile down to a Single Static Assignment Ir.
Some optimization passes over Basic Blocks have been completed like Dead Code elimination and Common Sub Expression Elimination
It also performs constant folding.

# What is next
I plan on adding support for more Global Analysis features. 
I also have to support generation into the ARM7TDMIS architecture. 
I plan on integrating this compiler into the ARM7TDMIS Emulator project that is on my github.
